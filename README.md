<h2>Building single-page applications with Backbone.js and Drupal</h2>
This is the home of ‘Building single-page applications with Backbone.js and Drupal’ for creating RESTful applications using the javascript framework, Backbone.js, and content management framework, Drupal. This is a in-progress book, open for community feedback.

<h2>Ideas or feedback?</h2>
This is all rough and a huge work in progress for me. If you have feedback, open an issue, submit a pull request, or mention me on Twitter @davepoon.
